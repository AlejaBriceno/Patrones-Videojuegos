# Pattern Identification: Video Game Store
Identified patterns that determine whether a video game is successful or not. Trends such as sales, release year, genre, and ratings were analyzed to detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

## 🛠️ Technologies used:
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

## ✅ Objectives:
-Observe and analyze how sales vary across different platforms.
-Identify how user and professional reviews impact platform sales.
-Determine the most profitable genres by examining overall data distribution.

## 🔍 Procedure
1. Read the data
2. Data preparation: check for duplicates, missing values, data types, rename columns
3. Data analysis: calculate sales by platform, create a scatter plot and calculate the correlation between reviews and sales, test hypotheses


## 📊 Results:
-It was found that the platforms with the highest sales are PS2, X360, Wii, PS3, and DS; the other platforms do not have significant popularity.
-It is concluded that ratings are not directly related to sales volume, since there are games with high ratings that have not shown large sales volumes.
-It is evident that the median sales across all platforms have been different, indicating variability in their performance—except for Xone and 3DS, which have shown similar behavior.
